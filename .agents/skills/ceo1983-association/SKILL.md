# CEO 1983 Association Application Skill

This skill defines the technical standards, architectural patterns, and business domain knowledge for the **CEO 1983 Association Mobile Web Application** (`@ceo1983/app_fe`), located in `apps/ceo1983_app_fe`.

## 1. Domain & Purpose

The application serves business owners, founders, and C-level executives in the **CLB Doanh Nhân CEO 1983** (HanoiBA). It is not a generic social network; it is an executive digital ecosystem designed for:
- **Executive Identity & Digital Card**: Luxury smart member card with company logo branding, personal QR code, and public digital visiting card (`/card/:code`).
- **B2B Strategic Networking & Deals**: Targeted meeting requests (`[B2B_CONNECT_INVITE]`) with business purpose, contact info, and opportunity attachments.
- **Internal B2B Marketplace**: Enterprise product directory with luxury Obsidian & Amber Gold sponsor carousels and direct in-app seller negotiation.
- **Realtime Opportunities**: Aggregated supply, demand, and joint venture deals with live valuation metrics.
- **Event & Meeting Governance**: Online voting directly tied to physical/virtual general assemblies, board meetings, and conventions.
- **Administration & Committee RBAC**: Admin-controlled permission assignment across 7 specialized association committees.

## 3. Executive UI & Color Standards

Always strictly apply the official CEO 1983 palette:
- **Primary Cobalt Navy**: `#003B95`, `#00224F`
- **Accent Warm Amber Gold**: `#F59E0B`, `#D97706`, `#FEF3C7`
- **Deep Obsidian Dark**: `#0B132B`, `#0F172A`
- **Semantic Emerald**: `#059669`, `#10B981` (Success, Verified, Voted)
- **Semantic Ruby**: `#E11D48` (Declined, Alerts)

### Button-to-Icon Minimization
Do NOT clutter screens with bulky text buttons. Use sleek single-color Lucide icons (`<MessageSquare />`, `<Phone />`, `<User />`, `<Handshake />`). Reserve full buttons only for critical decisions (Edit Profile, Accept Meeting, Cast Vote).

## 4. Architectural Rules

1. **Route Generation**:
   Whenever a new route file is added or renamed in `src/routes/`, always execute:
   ```bash
   npm run routes:gen
   ```
   This regenerates `routeTree.gen.ts` before running TypeScript checks.

2. **TypeScript Integrity**:
   Verify code changes with:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```
   Must pass with **0 errors**.

3. **Git Hygiene**:
   **STRICT PROHIBITION**: Absolutely NEVER execute `git push` or `git commit`.
